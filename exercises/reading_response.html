    When I think about flow vs friction, what comes to mind is typography's crystal gobelet — the debate between stylistic choices as opposed to legibility is as old as recorded media, and I know the debate about the decline of humanity's mental capacities with the introduction of new media has been around since Socrates denounced writing as an unfit mode of communication. 
    I often wonder what the internet would look like if it had been made recently, as in if it'd been created with the technology we have now. Perhaps we'd have ways of navigating it that are unfathomable to us now simply because the internet as we know it is the result of decades of innovation and reinvention.
