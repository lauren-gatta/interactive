    When I think about flow vs friction, what comes to mind is typography's crystal gobelet — the debate between stylistic choices as opposed to legibility is as old as recorded media, and I know the debate about the decline of humanity's mental capacities with the introduction of new media has been around since Socrates denounced writing as an unfit mode of communication. <br>
    I often wonder what the internet would look like if it had been made recently, as in if it'd been created with the technology we have now. Perhaps we'd have ways of navigating it that are unfathomable to us now simply because the internet as we know it is the result of decades of innovation and reinvention.

    Every social media ever has mostly been about finding interesting ways of communicating with other humans. I can't think of any "social" media that doesn't revolve around communication in some way. And with the subjectivity of communication comes the biases of those who created those channels of human connection and sharing. I was really drawn to the arguments made in <i>Glitching the Master's House</i>, where "the simultaneous empowerment and disempowerment that Black people face in cyberspace, which of course mimics what is experienced offline [... is] never divorced from what happens when we [Black people] walk out on the streets." As objective as we think the internet might be, and in spite of its anonymity, it's still bound by so much of the rules that govern the physical world. On the internet, everyone is a white man. <br>
